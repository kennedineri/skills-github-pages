Hello, my name is Kennedi Neri! I'm a recent graduate from George Washington Univeristy with a B.S. in Business Analytics and a minor in Statisitcs. I'm highly interested in securing a full-time entry-level role as a data analyst. I'm currently located in Colorado Springs, CO but plan to relocate back to Washington, D.C. in the near future. I'm open to a variety of industries as I have experience working in consulting, finance, and cybersecurity.

My LinkedIn is accessible here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedineri/.
