Hello, my name is Kennedi Neri! I'm a recent graduate from George Washington Univeristy with a B.S. in Business Analytics (STEM) and a minor in Statisitcs. I'm currently searching for a full-time entry-level role as a data analyst in the DMV area.

I have skills in various analytical tools such as R Programming, Python, SQL, AWS EC2, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI. I've completed work in a few different industries including: consulting with PwC, finance at JP Morgan Chase, and (currently) entertainment with Beat by Dre. My academic projects have consisted of forecasting analytics, machine learning, web analytics, database management, decision models, network data, and data mining techniques to name some. 

In my free time I enjoy volunteer work with animals and children, cheering with my team, and planning corporate exploration treks with my organization, GW Women in Business.
